# Duct Logger [![Build Status](https://github.com/duct-framework/logger/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/duct-framework/logger/actions/workflows/test.yml)

A logging library for the [Duct][] framework.

[duct]: https://github.com/duct-framework/duct

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your deps.edn file:

    org.duct-framework/logger {:mvn/version "0.4.0"}

Or to your Leiningen project file:

    [org.duct-framework/logger "0.4.0"]

## Usage

To use this library, you'll need an implementation of the
`duct.logger/Logger` protocol. You can implement this yourself, or
use a pre-written one, such as [logger.simple][].

[logger.timbre]: https://github.com/duct-framework/logger.simple

Once you have a logger, you can use the `duct.logger/log`
macro. Logging in Duct is data-driven, and has three parts:

1. The logging level
2. A namespaced keyword that represents the event occurring
3. A map of relevant event data

For example, instead of writing something like this:

```clojure
(log/info "Starting server on port" port)
```

We instead write something like:

```clojure
(log/log logger :info ::starting-server {:port port})
```

The use of keywords and data structures produces logs that can be
queried more efficiently and consistantly than logs written in
English.

This library also provides convenience macros for the following logging
levels: `report`, `fatal`, `error`, `warn` `info` and `debug`. This
allows logs to be written:

```clojure
(log/info logger ::starting-server {:port port})
```

If the logger is `nil`, no logs are outputted. If the logger is a
collection of loggers, then each element of the collection will be sent
the log.
